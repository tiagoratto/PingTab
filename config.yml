# SamplingAmount : Defines the amount of samples used to calculate the average,
#                  notice that this setting can be tricky, since it can
#                  significantly increase memory consuption depending on the
#                  number of players and the amount of samples. Ie:
#                  - Default:
#                    100 players * 20 samples * 4 bytes = 8000 bytes or around
#                    8 KBytes.
#                  - Changed:
#                    100 players * 100 samples * 4 bytes = 40000 bytes or around
#                    40 Kbytes
